remove_duplicates
=================

Simple bash script to find duplicate files. My first attempt in bash scripting, mostly based on code published elsewhere by others, namely http://pastebin.com/EGEUfkx6. Modified to accept different folders, detect duplicate files with different filenames, and manage names with whitespaces.
